# YouTube-Video-Analysis-Python
Analyzed metrics with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), used Scikit-learn for machine learning to derive engagement metrics and optimize content strategies.
In this comprehensive YouTube video analysis project, we harnessed the power of Python, employing Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to delve into critical metrics. Through the YouTube API, we collected and processed data, ensuring its cleanliness and usability. Our focus then shifted to exploratory data analysis, utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib to visually uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset. To enhance our content strategy, we seamlessly integrated Scikit-learn, employing machine learning, particularly a Random Forest Regressor, to derive engagement metrics. The project's culmination involved leveraging these insights to optimize content strategies, fostering increased engagement and performance on the YouTube platform.
